# kitten_space_invaders
Kitten sprite avoids falling stars and tries to survive until the end. 

Need: python and pygames installed on your machine. 
      save all the files in the same directory (folder) and run main.py.

Goal: Make the kitten (the grey box) avoid the 'falling stars' (little white rectangles). Survive all 4 levels until the end of the rave concert.
Controls: up, down, left, right arrow keys ---> move // 
          space bar ---> makes the character say "meow"     

Debugging: If you would like to see all the levels without playing the game, move the character off screen and he will avoid all falling stars and survive.
